# Why Archive Chat?
Neuro's and Evil's streams often feature unique interactions with her audience that shape the tone, pacing, and humor of the content.
Unfortunately, Twitch chat is not always saved or accessible after streams end, especially after VODs are removed.
This repo ensures that those moments arenâ€™t lost to time.

It also provides a valuable resource for clippers, editors, and fans who want to include chat's reactions in their edits/content.

# Which Archive Applies To Which Stream?
To minimize the effort I need to put into archiving twitch chat, I do not edit the names of the files. All files are named by when the stream happened and what the title of the stream was at the end of stream.
The best I can give you is the date and hopefully you can figure it out from there if need be.

# How To Render Twitch Chat
Each twitch chat file is downloaded by using the tool "Twitch Downloader" by lay295 (Lewis Pardo). To render chat you first need to download this tool and use it's rendering feature.
