# Why Archive Chat?
Neuro's and Evil's streams often feature unique interactions with her audience that shape the tone, pacing, and humor of the content.
Unfortunately, Twitch chat is not always saved or accessible after streams end, especially after VODs are removed.
This repo ensures that those moments arenâ€™t lost to time.

It also provides a valuable resource for clippers, editors, and fans who want to include chat's reactions in their edits/content.

# How To Render Twitch Chat
Each twitch chat file is downloaded by using the tool "Twitch Downloader" by lay295 (Lewis Pardo). To render chat you first need to download this tool and use it's rendering feature.
